We have been visiting Famoso pizzeria for several months and in different cities.
Although not really invited by the music playing outside, we've decided to give it a chance. And the choice was simply... a surprise, a good one.
The owners claim that they visit Napoli very often and funded Famoso based on the traditional recipe of the Neapolitan pizza.
Being so lucky to taste tons of pizza ourselves in Italy, we can assure you that the recipe proposed by Famoso is definitely very similar to the traditional pizza.
Talking about the Queen of all the pizzas, the Margherita, we noticed that the dough is very well done, the tomato is just perfect, the mozzarella melts very well, maybe only the basil lacks of traditional italian taste.
By our opinion, you don't need to cover it with many ingredients to understand and recognize the unique taste of a well done traditional pizza.
Our biggest surprise was that there are many Famoso across Canada, we could not imagine such a good result from a franchise.
Another good note is that, on the menu, the international pizzas have been separated by the italian ones, showing respect for the origins of this recipe.
 
### Our Perfect dine at Famoso :
- Ceasars cocktail
- Margherita or Marinara(this one with double tomato sauce), no added parmezan.
- Affogato Mint and Stracciatella

### Cons
The service sometimes lacks of preparation and attention towards the guests, maybe because of staff's turnover

For us it is a safe place, the atmosphere is friendly, of course during the weekend it can be more frantic but always a pleasure to go there.
